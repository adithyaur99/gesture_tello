# gesture_tello

Gesture based control for Dji Tello Drone using an MPU 6050 Gyroscope

The Gyroscope detects hand movements, and this then gets translated by Arduino into movement by the drone

The Python program acts as a mediator between Arduino and the Drone

I have interfaced the gyroscope and there are 4 commands working currently 

Forward

Backward

Left

Right

I will try to Interface YAW axis and Altitude control using the same
